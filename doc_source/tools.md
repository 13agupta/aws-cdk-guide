# AWS CDK Command Line Toolkit \(cdk\)<a name="tools"></a>

The CDK Toolkit, cdk, is the main tool you use to interact with your CDK app\. It executes the CDK app you wrote and compiled, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the CDK\.

There are two ways to tell cdk what command to use to run your CDK app\. The first way is to include an explicit \-\-app option whenever you use a cdk command\.

```
cdk --app 'node bin/main.js' synth
```

The second way is to add the following entry to the `cdk.json` file\.

```
{
  "app": "node bin/main.js"
}
```

Here are the actions you can take on your CDK app \(this is the output of the cdk \-\-help command\)\.

```
Usage: cdk -a <cdk-app> COMMAND

Commands:
  list                        Lists all stacks in the app          [aliases: ls]
  synthesize [STACKS..]       Synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template
                              for this stack                    [aliases: synth]
  bootstrap [ENVIRONMENTS..]  Deploys the CDK toolkit stack into an AWS
                              environment
  deploy [STACKS..]           Deploys the stack(s) named STACKS into your AWS
                              account
  destroy [STACKS..]          Destroy the stack(s) named STACKS
  diff [STACKS..]             Compares the specified stack with the deployed
                              stack or a local template file, and returns with
                              status 1 if any difference is found
  metadata [STACK]            Returns all metadata associated with this stack

If your app has a single stack, there is no need to specify the stack name

If one of cdk.json or ~/.cdk.json exists, options specified there will be used
as defaults. Settings in cdk.json take precedence.
```

If your app has a single stack, you don't have to specify the stack name\.

If a `cdk.json` or `~/.cdk.json` file exists, options specified there are used as defaults\. Settings in `cdk.json` take precedence\.

## Bootstrapping the CDK<a name="tools_bootstrap"></a>

Before you can use the CDK you must bootstrap the CDK to create the infrastructure that the CDK needs\. Currently the bootstrap command creates only an Amazon S3 bucket\.

You incur any charges for what the CDK stores in the bucket\. Because the CDK does not remove any objects from the bucket, the bucket can accumulate objects as you use the CDK\. You can get rid of the bucket by deleting the **CDKToolkit** stack from your account\. 

## Security\-Related Changes<a name="tools_security"></a>

To protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture, the CDK toolkit prompts you to approve security\-related changes before deploying them\.

You change the level of changes that requires approval by specifying:

```
cdk deploy --require-approval LEVEL
```

Where *LEVEL* can be one of the following:

never  
Approval is never required\.

any\-change  
Requires approval on any IAM or security\-group related change\.

broadening  
\(default\) Requires approval when IAM statements or traffic rules are added\. Removals don't require approval\.

The setting can also be configured in the `cdk.json` file\.

```
{
  "app": "...",
  "requireApproval": "never"
}
```

## Version Reporting<a name="version_reporting"></a>

To gain insight into how the CDK is used, the versions of libraries used by CDK applications are collected and reported by using a resource identified as `AWS::CDK::Metadata`\. This resource is added to AWS CloudFormation templates, and can easily be reviewed\. This information can also be used to identify stacks using a package with known serious security or reliability issues, and to contact their users with important information\.

The CDK reports the name and version of `npm` modules that are loaded into the application at synthesis time, unless their `package.json` file contains the `"private": true` attribute\.

The `AWS::CDK::Metadata` resource looks like the following\.

```
CDKMetadata:
  Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
  Properties:
    Modules: "@aws-cdk/core=0.7.2-beta,@aws-cdk/s3=0.7.2-beta,lodash=4.17.10"
```

## Opting Out from Version Reporting<a name="version_reporting_opt_out"></a>

To opt out of version reporting, use one of the following methods:
+ Use the cdk command with the \-\-no\-version\-reporting argument\.

  ```
  cdk --no-version-reporting synth
  ```
+ Set versionReporting to **false** in `./cdk.json` or `~/cdk.json`\.

  ```
  {
    "app": "...",
    "versionReporting": false
  }
  ```

## Plugins<a name="tools_plugins"></a>

The CDK Toolkit provides extension points that enable users to augment the features provided by the toolkit\. There is currently only one extension point, allowing users to define custom AWS credential providers, but other extension points may be added in the future as needed\.

### Loading Plugins<a name="tools_loading_plugins"></a>

Plugins can be loaded by providing the Node module name \(or path\) to the CDK Toolkit:
+ Using the \-\-plugin command line option, which can be specified multiple times\.

  ```
  cdk list --plugin=module
  cdk deploy --plugin=module_1 --plugin=module_2
  ```
+ Adding entries to the `~/.cdk.json` or `cdk.json` file\.

  ```
  {
    // ...
    "plugin": [
      "module_1",
      "module_2"
    ],
    // ...
  }
  ```

### Authoring Plugins<a name="tools_authoring_plugins"></a>

Plugins must be authored in TypeScript or JavaScript, and are defined by implementing a Node\.js module that implements the following protocol, and using [PluginHost\(\)](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/tools.html#aws-cdk.PluginHost) methods\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
import cdk = require('aws-cdk');

export = {
  version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
  init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
    // Your plugin initialization hook.
    // Use methods of host to register custom code with the CDK Toolkit.
  }
};
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

```
export = {
  version: '1', // Version of the plugin infrastructure (currently always '1')
  init(host) {
    // Your plugin initialization hook.
    // Use methods of host to register custom code with the CDK Toolkit.
  }
};
```

------

### Credential Provider Plugins<a name="tools_creds_plugins"></a>

Custom credential providers are classes that implement the [CredentialProviderSource\(\)](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/tools.html#aws-cdk.CredentialProviderSource) interface, and that are registered to the toolkit using the [registerCredentialProviderSource\(\)](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/tools.html#aws-cdk.PluginHost.registerCredentialProviderSource) method\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
import cdk = require('aws-cdk');
import aws = require('aws-sdk');

class CustomCredentialProviderSource implements cdk.CredentialProviderSource {
  public async isAvailable(): Promise<boolean> {
    // Return false if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
    // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
    return true;
  }

  public async canProvideCredentials(accountId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Return false if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
    // requested account (for example, if it's not managed by the credentials
    // system that this plugin adds support for).
    return true;
  }

  public async getProvider(accountId: string, mode: cdk.Mode): Promise<aws.Credentials> {
    let credentials: aws.Credentials;
    // Somehow obtain credentials in credentials, and return those.
    return credentials;
  }
}

export = {
  version = '1',
  init(host: cdk.PluginHost): void {
    // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
    host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
  }
};
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

```
class CustomCredentialProviderSource {
  async isAvailable() {
    // Return false if the plugin could determine it cannot be used (for example,
    // if it depends on files that are not present on this host).
    return true;
  }

  async canProvideCredentials(accountId) {
    // Return false if the plugin is unable to provide credentials for the
    // requested account (for example if it's not managed by the credentials
    // system that this plugin adds support for).
    return true;
  }

  async getProvider(accountId, mode) {
    let credentials;
    // Somehow obtain credentials in credentials, and return those.
    return credentials;
  }
}

export = {
  version = '1',
  init(host) {
    // Register the credential provider to the PluginHost.
    host.registerCredentialProviderSource(new CustomCredentialProviderSource());
  }
};
```

------

Note that the credentials obtained from the providers for a given account and mode will be cached, and as a consequence, we strongly advise that the credentials objects that are returned are self\-refreshing, as described in the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Credentials.html) documentation\.

# About the Reference<a name="reference"></a>

See the [CDK Reference](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/) for information about the CDK libraries\.

Each library contains information about how to use the library\. For example, the [Amazon S3](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html) library demonstrates how to set default encryption on an Amazon S3 bucket\.

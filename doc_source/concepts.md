# AWS CDK Concepts<a name="concepts"></a>

This topic describes some of the concepts \(the why and how\) behind the CDK\. It also discusses the advantages of the AWS Construct Library over a low\-level AWS CloudFormation Resource\.

CDK apps are composed of building blocks known as [Constructs](constructs.md), which are used to create [stacks](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#@aws-cdk/cdk.Stack) and [apps](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#app)\.
